('moon jellyfish', false, 'aurelia aurita', 'Commonly found in coastal waters around the world, non-venomous. The Moon Jellyfish (Aurelia aurita) is a fascinating marine species known for its translucent, saucer-shaped bell and delicate, short tentacles. One of its most distinctive features is the four horseshoe-shaped gonads visible through its translucent bell, giving it a unique appearance. These jellyfish are prevalent in coastal waters around the world, often found in large swarms, and play a crucial role in marine ecosystems as both predators and prey. Moon jellyfish primarily feed on plankton and small aquatic organisms, capturing them with their tentacles stinging cells. Despite their stinging capability, their venom is relatively mild and poses little threat to humans, making them a popular species in public aquariums. Their ethereal beauty and graceful movements continue to captivate both scientists and ocean enthusiasts alike.', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurelia_aurita', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/27/Moon_jellyfish_at_Gota_Sagher.JPG/1024px-Moon_jellyfish_at_Gota_Sagher.JPG'),
('lions mane', true, 'cyanea capillata', 'The Lions Mane Jellyfish (Cyanea capillata) is a remarkable species known for being one of the largest jellyfish in the world. Its most distinctive feature is its enormous, vibrant, red or orange bell, which can reach up to 2.5 meters (8 feet) in diameter, with tentacles that can extend over 30 meters (100 feet) in length. These tentacles are divided into eight clusters, each containing up to 150 individual tentacles, creating a mane-like appearance that gives the species its name. The Lions Mane Jellyfish inhabits cold waters of the Arctic, Northern Atlantic, and Northern Pacific Oceans. Its sting is more potent than that of many other jellyfish species, capable of causing severe pain and, in rare cases, serious medical issues in humans. The sheer size and striking appearance of the Lions Mane Jellyfish make it a fascinating subject of study and admiration in the marine world.', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lion%27s_mane_jellyfish', 'https://images.fineartamerica.com/images/artworkimages/mediumlarge/2/28-lions-mane-jellyfish-alexander-semenovscience-photo-library.jpg'),
('portuguese man-o-war', true, 'physalia physalis', 'Found in the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Oceans, highly venomous. The Portuguese Man o War (Physalia physalis) is a notorious marine creature often mistaken for a jellyfish, but it is actually a siphonophoreâ€”a colony of specialized individual organisms working together. Its most distinctive feature is its gas-filled, blue or purple bladder, which floats on the surface of the water and can extend up to 30 centimeters (12 inches) above the surface, acting as a sail. Below the float, long, venomous tentacles can stretch up to 50 meters (165 feet) in length, used to capture and paralyze small fish and other prey. The Portuguese Man o War is found in warm ocean waters and is known for its painful and potentially dangerous sting, which can cause severe reactions in humans, including intense pain, welts, and, in rare cases, systemic symptoms. Despite its fearsome reputation, the Portuguese Man o War plays a role in the ocean ecosystem as both predator and prey, contributing to the balance of marine life.', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_man_o%27_war', 'https://images.fineartamerica.com/images-medium-large/portuguese-man-of-war-jellyfish-jeanne-woods.jpg'),

('irukandji jellyfish', true, 'carukia barnesi', 'Found in the waters of northern Australia, extremely venomous. The Irukandji Jellyfish (Carukia barnesi) is a small but extremely venomous jellyfish species found primarily in the waters of northern Australia. Despite its diminutive size, with a bell measuring only about 2 centimeters (0.8 inches) in diameter, the Irukandji packs a powerful punch. It is known for its nearly transparent appearance, which makes it difficult to spot in the water, and its long, thin tentacles that can extend up to 1 meter (3 feet) in length.
The sting of the Irukandji Jellyfish is infamous for causing Irukandji syndrome, a condition characterized by severe pain, nausea, vomiting, headaches, and in some cases, high blood pressure and heart problems. The symptoms can be life-threatening and often require medical treatment. Due to its small size and potent venom, the Irukandji Jellyfish is considered one of the most dangerous jellyfish species in the world.

('mauve stinger', false, 'pelagia noctiluca', 'Found in the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans, can cause a painful sting. The Mauve Stinger (Pelagia noctiluca) is a species of jellyfish known for its distinctive purplish or mauve coloration, which gives it its common name. The bell of the Mauve Stinger can reach up to 10 centimeters (4 inches) in diameter and is covered with small, wart-like bumps. It has eight long, slender tentacles and four oral arms that hang beneath the bell, all of which are equipped with stinging cells called nematocysts.
The Mauve Stinger is found in warm and temperate waters of the Atlantic Ocean, the Mediterranean Sea, and the Pacific Ocean. It is a pelagic species, meaning it lives in the open ocean rather than near the seafloor. The Mauve Stinger is known for its bioluminescence; it can produce a beautiful, glowing light when disturbed, which is thought to be a defense mechanism to startle predators.
While the sting of the Mauve Stinger can cause pain and irritation to humans, it is generally not considered dangerous. However, large swarms of these jellyfish can occasionally impact coastal areas, causing discomfort to swimmers and affecting tourism. The Mauve Stingers striking appearance and bioluminescent properties make it an interesting subject for marine biologists and enthusiasts alike.', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelagia_noctiluca', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/82/Pelagiidae_-_Pelagia_noctiluca.jpg/800px-Pelagiidae_-_Pelagia_noctiluca.jpg'),

Nomuras Jellyfish (Nemopilema nomurai) is one of the largest jellyfish species, known for its immense size and significant impact on fishing industries. This giant jellyfish can grow up to 2 meters (6.6 feet) in diameter and weigh up to 200 kilograms (440 pounds). It is primarily found in the waters of the Yellow Sea, the East China Sea, and the Sea of Japan. Nomuras Jellyfish is distinguishable by its large, bulbous bell, which is typically a pink or yellowish color, and its short, thick tentacles that contain stinging cells used for capturing prey and defense.
One of the most notable distinctions of Nomuras Jellyfish is its ability to form massive blooms, which can consist of thousands of individuals and pose significant challenges to fishing operations by damaging nets, spoiling catches, and even capsizing small boats. These blooms are thought to be influenced by environmental factors such as water temperature and nutrient availability. The sheer size and impact of Nomuras Jellyfish make it a subject of interest and concern for marine scientists and fishermen alike, as they seek to understand and mitigate its effects on marine ecosystems and human activities.', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomura%27s_jellyfish', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b7/Nomura_jellyfish_2009_Korea_a.jpg/1024px-Nomura_jellyfish_2009_Korea_a.jpg'),

The bell can grow up to 25 centimeters (10 inches) in diameter and is usually a shade of milky white or pale yellow. Unlike many other jellyfish, the Cannonball Jellyfish lacks long, trailing tentacles. Instead, it has a fringe of short, thick tentacles around the edge of its bell and a cluster of oral arms beneath the bell that are used for feeding.
The Cannonball Jellyfish is found in warm coastal waters, particularly in the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico. It is known for its relatively mild sting, which is not considered dangerous to humans and often results in little more than minor skin irritation. This species is also notable for its role in the marine ecosystem, serving as a food source for a variety of predators, including the endangered leatherback sea turtle.
