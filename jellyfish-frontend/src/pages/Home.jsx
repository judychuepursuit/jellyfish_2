        Jellyfish are a diverse group of marine invertebrates belonging to the phylum Cnidaria. They are characterized by their gelatinous, umbrella-shaped bodies called bells, and trailing tentacles equipped with stinging cells called nematocysts. Jellyfish have been in existence for over 500 million years, making them one of the oldest living organisms on Earth.</p>
        <p>Jellyfish play several important roles in marine ecosystems. They are a crucial part of the food chain, serving as prey for larger marine animals such as fish, turtles, and birds. Some species of jellyfish are also efficient predators, helping to control populations of smaller planktonic organisms. In addition, jellyfish blooms can influence nutrient cycling and energy flow within marine environments.</p>
        <p>Overall, jellyfish are fascinating creatures with a long evolutionary history, ecological significance, and a range of venomous capabilities that have intrigued scientists and the public alike.</p>
